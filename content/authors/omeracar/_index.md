I am PhD student in Computational Biology in CMU-Pitt Joint PhD program. I consider myself as a data scientist working on biological data. My research interests include network biology, molecular evolution, and understanding evolution of species from a systems and network biology perspective. 

I like to learn new things from front end web technologies to machine learning algortihms. I always admire cool data visualizations. 
I do everything in R and Python and I advocate open source software, open access and reproducible research/science.
