I am PhD student in Computational Biology in CMU-Pitt Joint program. My research interests include but not limited to Yeast genetics and evolution, network biology, understanding evolution of species with a systems biology perspective. 
I do everything in R and I advocate open source software, open access and reproducible research/science.
